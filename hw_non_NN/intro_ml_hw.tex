        $r=[5, 50, 100, 300]$.}

Note that in Fig. \ref{fig_1.2_1}, $x_{784}$ is the true image. Also, note that
the mean of the data was re-introduced when generating this plot.

The digits 4 and 9 appear difficult to separate as they lie in the same region
and have significant overlap. The digits 0 and 9 appear easy to separate as they
lie in separate regfions with minimal overlap.

\subsection{}  % 2.5 -------------------------------------------
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{2.5fig1.png}
    \caption{Hardest digit pair for LDA: 3 and 5}

    \caption{Easiest digit pair for LDA: 6 and 7}
    \label{fig_2.5_2}
\end{figure}

In Fig. \ref{fig_2.5_1}, there is significant overlap between the regions
occupied by the two digits. In contrast, in Fig. \ref{fig_2.5_2}, there is
a relatively clean separation betwen the regions occupied by the two digits.
